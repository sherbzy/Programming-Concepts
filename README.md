This repository contains the projects from the Programming Concepts course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Fall 2019. The assignments for this class were separated into 8 sets with each set containing a few simple labs used for teaching along with one more challinging assignment where students implement what was learned in the labs. Unfortunately, I did not save the actual assignment descriptions from this class, but each program should contain a header with a description of the intended functionality. Each program was written in C++ using CLion.

This course introduces fundamental computer programming concepts using a high-level language and a modern development environment. Programming skills include sequential, selection, and repetition control structures, functions, input and output, primitive data types, basic data structures including arrays and pointers, objects, and classes. Software engineering skills include problem solving, program design, and debugging practices.

Well, that's the official, boring description. The goal of this course is to open your mind to computational thinking, to educate you to leverage programs as tools in your field of study, and to empower you with a fundamental knowledge of programming. 

Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
 - Design an algorithm to solve a problem by breaking the overarching problem in to smaller modular components using abstraction and object-oriented design with inheritance.
 - Translate the algorithm into a program using proper C++ syntax and fundamental programming constructs (e.g. control structures, I/O, classes).
 - Recite & apply frequently used Linux command line commands and compile a program using a command line build system.
 - Diagram memory usage, dynamically allocate & deallocate objects at run-time using "The Big Three," and trace the call stack of a program's run-time.
 - Define recursion and construct common recursive data structures (e.g. linked list, stack, queue) & algorithms (e.g. search & sort).
 - Diagram & construct dynamically allocated data structures (e.g. array, vector, string), recursive data structures (e.g. linked list, stack, queue), and implement common list operations (e.g. traversal, insertion, removal)
 - Define "Big-O" notation, list complexities in increasing order, and analyze an algorithm to compute its run-time performance & memory complexities.
